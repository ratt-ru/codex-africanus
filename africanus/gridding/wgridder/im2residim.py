    Compute residual image given a model and visibilities using ducc
    degridder i.e.

    .. math::


        I^R = R^\dagger \Sigma^{-1}(V - Rx)

    where :math:`R` is an implicit degridding operator, :math:`V`
    denotes visibilities of shape :code:`(row, chan)` and
    :math:`x` is the image of shape :code:`(band, nx, ny)`.

    The number of imaging bands :code:`(band)` must
    be less than or equal to the number of channels
    :code:`(chan)` at which the data were obtained.
    The mapping from :code:`(chan)` to :code:`(band)` is described
    by :code:`freq_bin_idx` and :code:`freq_bin_counts` as
    described below.

    Note that, if the gridding and degridding operators both apply
    the square root of the imaging weights then the visibilities
    that are passed in should be pre-whitened. In this case the
    function computes

    .. math::


        I^R = R^\dagger \Sigma^{-\frac{1}{2}}(\tilde{V}
              - \Sigma^{-\frac{1}{2}}Rx)

    which is identical to the above expression if
    :math:`\tilde{V} = \Sigma^{-\frac{1}{2}}V`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    uvw : $(array_type)
        uvw coordinates at which visibilities were
        obtained with shape :code:`(row, 3)`.
    freq : $(array_type)
        Observational frequencies of shape :code:`(chan,)`.
    model : $(array_type)
        Model image to degrid of shape :code:`(band, nx, ny)`.
    vis : $(array_type)
        Visibilities of shape :code:`(row,chan)`.
    weights : $(array_type)
        Imaging weights of shape :code:`(row, chan)`.
    freq_bin_idx : $(array_type)
        Starting indices of frequency bins for each imaging
        band of shape :code:`(band,)`.
    freq_bin_counts : $(array_type)
        The number of channels in each imaging band of shape :code:`(band,)`.
    cell : float
        The cell size of a pixel along the :math:`x` direction in radians.
    flag: $(array_type), optional
        Flags of shape :code:`(row,chan)`. Will only process visibilities
        for which flag!=0
    celly : float, optional
        The cell size of a pixel along the :math:`y` direction in radians.
        By default same as cell size along :math:`x` direction.
    nu : int, optional
        The number of pixels in the padded grid along the :math:`x` direction.
        Chosen automatically by default.
    nv : int, optional
        The number of pixels in the padded grid along the :math:`y` direction.
        Chosen automatically by default.
    epsilon : float, optional
        The precision of the gridder with respect to the direct Fourier
        transform. By deafult, this is set to :code:`1e-5` for single
        precision and :code:`1e-7` for double precision.
    nthreads : int, optional
        The number of threads to use. Defaults to one.
    do_wstacking : bool, optional
        Whether to correct for the w-term or not. Defaults to True

    Returns
    -------
    residual : $(array_type)
        Residual image corresponding to :code:`model` of shape
        :code:`(band, nx, ny)`.
