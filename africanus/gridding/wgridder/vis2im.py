    Compute visibility to image mapping using ducc gridder i.e.

    .. math::


        I^D = R^\dagger \Sigma^{-1} V

    where :math:`R^\dagger` is an implicit gridding operator,
    :math:`V` denotes visibilities of shape :code:`(row, chan)` and
    :math:`I^D` is the dirty image of shape :code:`(band, nx, ny)`.

    The number of imaging bands :code:`(band)` must
    be less than or equal to the number of channels
    :code:`(chan)` at which the data were obtained.
    The mapping from :code:`(chan)` to :code:`(band)` is described
    by :code:`freq_bin_idx` and :code:`freq_bin_counts` as
    described below.

    Note that, if self adjoint gridding and degridding operators
    are required then :code:`weights` should be the square
    root of what is typically referred to as imaging weights and
    should also be passed into the degridder.
    In this case, the data needs to be pre-whitened.

    Parameters
    ----------
    uvw : $(array_type)
        uvw coordinates at which visibilities were
        obtained with shape :code:`(row, 3)`.
    freq : $(array_type)
        Observational frequencies of shape :code:`(chan,)`.
    vis : $(array_type)
        Visibilities of shape :code:`(row,chan)`.
    freq_bin_idx : $(array_type)
        Starting indices of frequency bins for each imaging
        band of shape :code:`(band,)`.
    freq_bin_counts : $(array_type)
        The number of channels in each imaging band of shape :code:`(band,)`.
    cell : float
        The cell size of a pixel along the :math:`x` direction in radians.
    weights : $(array_type), optional
        Imaging weights of shape :code:`(row, chan)`.
    flag: $(array_type), optional
        Flags of shape :code:`(row,chan)`. Will only process visibilities
        for which flag!=0
    celly : float, optional
        The cell size of a pixel along the :math:`y` direction in radians.
        By default same as cell size along :math:`x` direction.
    epsilon : float, optional
        The precision of the gridder with respect to the direct Fourier
        transform. By deafult, this is set to :code:`1e-5` for single
        precision and :code:`1e-7` for double precision.
    nthreads : int, optional
        The number of threads to use. Defaults to one.
        If set to zero will use all available cores.
    do_wstacking : bool, optional
        Whether to correct for the w-term or not. Defaults to True

    Returns
    -------
    model : $(array_type)
        Dirty image corresponding to visibilities
        of shape :code:`(nband, nx, ny)`.
